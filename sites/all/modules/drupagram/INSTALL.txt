Dependencies
============

Make sure you download the oAuth module (http://dgo.to/oauth) and enable the 
oauth_common module.

This module comes with a couple of pre-made views so although it is not a 
dependency, it is a good idea to turn on the views and views_ui module.

The images are fetched on cron runs. Although you can manually trigger cron, in
order to maximize your experience with this app it is recommended that you setup
cron correctly.


Enabling the module
===================

Once you have taken care of the dependencies above, enable the drupagram module.
You should get a nice confirmation message with instructions on where to go to
fill out the variables required to connect to Tumblr API.

You will be presented with a link to admin/settings/services/instagram where you
will see a form. To enable OAuth based access for drupagram, you must register 
your application with Instagram and add the provided keys.

To register your app, click the "register your application" link or go to
http://instagr.am/developer/manage/ and follow their registration steps. Notice
that the callback URL MUST be http://YOUR-SITE-NAME/instagram/oauth

When you're done, copy the Instagram Client ID and Instagram Client Secret keys
over to the Drupal site and hit the Save configuration button.


How to add an Instagram account to a Drupal user account
========================================================

If all the steps above were successful you should now be able to go in and edit
any username and link an Instagr.am account to it.

If you are the site admin or a user with the "add instagram accounts" permission
you should be able to edit a user. Go to /user, notice you should be able to see
an Edit and an Instagram tab.

Click on the Edit tab and then choose the Instagram accounts sub tab.

Hit the Add account button. You will be taken to an Instagr.am authorization 
page. Enter your credentials and proceed to authorize the Drupal application.

You will then be redirected to the site and your Instagram profile information
should be listed. Hit the Save changes and you're done.

When cron runs, it will fetch any new pictures you have posted from the linked
account.
